# üß† Object Tracking using OpenCV (CSRT Tracker)

This project demonstrates a basic object tracking system using **OpenCV** and the **CSRT tracker**. The user selects a **Region of Interest (ROI)** in the first frame from the webcam, and the tracker follows it in real time.

---

## üöÄ How to Run the Project

### ‚úÖ Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher  
- OpenCV ‚â• 4.5 (must include `cv2.legacy` module)  
- A working webcam  

---

### üß© Install Dependencies

Use the following command to install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install opencv-python opencv-contrib-python
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Do **not** use `opencv-python-headless` ‚Äî it disables GUI functions like `cv2.imshow()` and `cv2.selectROI()`.

---

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Tracker

Run the Python script:

```bash
python object_tracker.py
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Tracker

Run the Python script:

```bash
python object_tracker.py
```

Then follow these steps:

1. A window will open showing your webcam feed.
2. Use your mouse to select the object you want to track.
3. Press `ENTER` or `SPACE` to confirm the selection.
4. The CSRT tracker will begin tracking the selected object in real time.

## üõ†Ô∏è Notes

- If the camera fails to start, make sure it's not being used by another app.
- If you see an error like `cv2.error: (-215:Assertion failed)`, make sure the frame is not empty and your webcam is working.
- If you get `AttributeError: module 'cv2' has no attribute 'TrackerCSRT_create'`, your OpenCV version might be incompatible. Use `cv2.legacy.TrackerCSRT_create()` instead.
- This script uses `cv2.legacy.TrackerCSRT_create()` ‚Äî make sure your OpenCV version supports it.
